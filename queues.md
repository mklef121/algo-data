## What is a queue
Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology.


Major Operations on queues are 

- **enqueue** − add (store) an item to the queue.
- **dequeue** − remove (access) an item from the queue.
- **peek** - viewing the first item in the queue
