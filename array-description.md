## When to use arrays 

Arrays are very good for 
- fast look up
- fast push or pop
- ordering or sorting

Arrays perform horribly for 

- Insertion. ( inserting into an existing index means re-ordering almost the entire array (O(n)))
- Slow deletes
- static arrays (like arrays in go) have fixed sizes
