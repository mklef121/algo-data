Go also comes with concurrency capabilities using a simple concurrency model that is implemented using goroutines and channels. Go manages OS threads for you and has a powerful runtime that allows you to spawn lightweight units of work (goroutines) that communicate with each other using channels.


### Why Use Go ?

Each Go source code begins with a package declaration. In this case, the name of the package is **main**, which has a special meaning in Go.

there is a global Go rule that also applies to function and variable names and is valid for all packages except main: everything that begins with a lowercase letter is considered private and is accessible in the current package only. 

Go programs are organized in packagesâ€”even the smallest Go program should be delivered as a package. 

every statement that exists outside of the code of a function must begin with a keyword such as func or var.
