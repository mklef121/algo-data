> This chapter teaches you about systems programming in Go. Systems programming involves working with files and directories, process control, signal handling, network programming, system files, configuration files, and file input and output (I/O).


Remember that UNIX considers everything, even a printer or your mouse, as a file. UNIX uses **file descriptors**, which are **positive integer** values, as an internal representation for accessing open files, which is much prettier than using long paths.

### stdin, stdout, and stderr
Every UNIX operating system has three files open all the time for its processes.
So, by default, all UNIX systems support three special and standard filenames: `/dev/stdin`, `/dev/stdout`, and `/dev/stderr`
which can also be accessed using file descriptors **0, 1, and 2**, respectively.
These three file descriptors are also called standard input, standard output, and standard error, respectively.


Go uses `os.Stdin` for accessing standard input, `os.Stdout` for accessing standard output, and `os.Stderr` for accessing standard error.


### UNIX processes

**A process** is an execution environment that contains instructions, user data and system data parts, and other types of resources that are obtained during runtime.

**A program** is a binary file that contains instructions and data that are used for initializing the instruction and user data parts of a process. 

Each running UNIX process is uniquely identified by an **unsigned integer**, which is called the process ID of the process.

There are three process categories: **user processes**, **daemon processes**, and **kernel processes**. 

- User processes run in user space and usually have no special access rights.
- Daemon processes are programs that can be found in the user space and run in the background without the need for a terminal
- Kernel processes are executed in kernel space only and can fully access all kernel data structures.


### Handling UNIX signals

A signal is a message which can be sent to a running process **asynchronously**.
Signals can be initiated by programs, users, or administrators.

For instance `ps aux` lists all the available 

Then the `kill` command is used to send signals to a process

e.g
The proper method of telling the Internet Daemon (inetd) to re-read its configuration file is to send it a SIGHUP signal.

`kill -SIGHUP 4140`

UNIX signal handling requires the use of **Go channels** that are used exclusively for this task.
The concurrency model of Go requires the use of goroutines and channels.

### Concurrency and signal handling in Go

A **goroutine** is the smallest executable Go entity.

A **channel** in Go is a mechanism that among other things allows goroutines to communicate and exchange data.

> Some signals cannot be caught, and the operating system cannot ignore them. So, the **SIGKILL** and **SIGSTOP** signals cannot be blocked, caught, or ignored and the reason for this is that they allow privileged users as well as the UNIX kernel to terminate any process they desire.

## File I/O

Remember we said earlier that unix treats everything (I/O) as a file and attaches it a positive interger to represent it.
Go has two major interfaces for reading and writing to files. They are  `io.Reader` and `io.Writer`.
These two interfaces are the basis of file I/O in Go

 The definition of the io.Reader interface is the following:
```go
type Reader interface {
    Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}

// The Read() method takes a byte slice as input, which is going to be filled with data up to its length, and returns the number of bytes read as well as an error variable.
```

The definition of the io.Writer interface is the following:

```go
type Writer interface {
    Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}

//The Write() method takes a byte slice, which contains the data that you want to write, as input and returns the number of bytes written and an error variable
```

### Buffered and unbuffered file I/O

Buffered file I/O happens when there is a buffer for temporarily storing data before reading data or writing data. Thus, instead of reading a file byte by byte, you read many bytes at once. You put the data in a buffer and wait for someone to read it in the desired way.

Unbuffered file I/O happens when there is no buffer to temporarily store data before actually reading or writing itâ€”this can affect the performance of your programs.

The next question that you might ask is how to decide **when to use buffered and when to use unbuffered file I/O**. 

* When dealing with critical data, unbuffered file I/O is generally a better choice because buffered reads might result in out-of-
date data and buffered writes might result in data loss when the power of your computer is interrupted.
* However, keep in mind that buffered readers can also improve performance by reducing the number of system calls needed to read from a file or socket.
