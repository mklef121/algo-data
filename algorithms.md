### What are algorithms ?

Algorithms are steps in a process programmers use to solve a particular problem or perform a desired action with computers.

Algorithms allow us to use data structures to perform action on data


### What Is a Technical Indicator?
> Technical indicators are heuristic or pattern-based signals produced by the price, volume, and/or open interest of a security or contract used by traders who follow technical analysis.

### Fibonacci
fibonacci series is a series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

The series was developed by the Italian mathematician, commonly referred to as "Fibonacci,"

In practice Fibonacci can be used for

- Fibonacci numbers are used to create technical indicators using a mathematical sequence


The early part of the sequence is `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,144, 233, 377, ...`

Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort 
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Heap sort (Learn about it later)

### When to use which sorting algorithm

1. Insertion Sort: When the list is quite small and list is probably a bit sorted
2. merge sort: Very good for worst case scenario although uses a lot of space complexity
3. Quick sort: Uses less space complexity: But when a bad pivot is picked, then uses O(n^2)


### Searching algorithm

- Linear search: This takes O(n) complexity since every single item is checked one by one
- Binary search: This uses the idea of divide and conquer by dividing the list or tree from left or right of a selected item and discarding the smaller part until the answer is found. This works usually for sorted lists or tree data structure.

### Examples of Binary Search algorithm

- Breadth first search
- Dept first search


Dept first search has different ways of searching
