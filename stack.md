## What's a stack

A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) that serves as a collection of Items and necessarily serves two major purposes
- **Push** - which adds an element to the collection. Time Complexity is O(1), 
- **Pop** -  which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. Time Complexity is O(1)
- **Peek** - viewing the first item in the queue. Time Complexity is O(1)

Stack allows all data operations at one end only. At any given time, we can only access the top element of a stack.

This feature makes it **LIFO** data structure. **LIFO stands for Last-in-first-out**. Here, the element which is placed (inserted or added) last, is accessed first.
