## What's a stack

A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) that serves as a collection of Items and necessarily serves two major ourposes
- **Push** - which adds an element to the collection
- **Pop** -  which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
- **peek** - viewing the first item in the queue

Stack allows all data operations at one end only. At any given time, we can only access the top element of a stack.

This feature makes it **LIFO** data structure. **LIFO stands for Last-in-first-out**. Here, the element which is placed (inserted or added) last, is accessed first.
