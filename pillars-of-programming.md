#### The three pillars of programming 

There are three vital points to consider when coding, they are very important to our products.
They are

1. **Readability :** This referes to how clean and maintainable our code is. We must write code that other people can also read and quickly understand
2. **Memory :** What is used in measuring this is **Space Complexity**. Computers hacve limited memories and most of our transient variables and data in our code is stored on the Ram. This means we must write space efficient code that does not clog memory.
3. **Time :** The time a code takes to complete is very important to our programmes because is determines how fast our software is. **Time Complexity** is used in making right assumptions about this.

> Both Time and Memory assumptions and estimations are made with Big O

Variables are usually stored in the heap.
Stack is usually used to keep track of function calls
